# What we save

To keep the system safe, we save these data:

## Activity Type,  Statement ID, Timestamp

We save the Activity Type,  Statement ID and Timestamp of each generated Learning Record Document in a database. 

The Activity Type is the type, like Webinar, Course or Video. We do not save the entered activity details, like title or description.

The Statement ID is a GUID and does not contain any other information than a GUID. We do not save any personal data.

The timestamp is the time when the Learning Record Document has been generated.
